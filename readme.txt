Cop Helper

I like watch detective stories and films very much. One day, I was watching a detective show, suddenly an idea came into my head: to create an app to check if two peoples know each other.

Use a database to store Personal information, like he or she works at xxx company from xxxx to xxxx.
Use python to check if any overlap blablabla
